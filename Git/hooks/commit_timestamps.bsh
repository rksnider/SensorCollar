#   @brief      Update all commit timestamp files with current time.
#   @details    This script finds all files with the commit timestamp
#               file name in the current directory tree and re-writes
#               them with the current time (just prior to the project
#               being comitted).  Seconds since the Unix epoch are used.
#               (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z)
#               This file will need to be renamed to 'pre-commit' in the
#               '.git/hooks' directory or run from the script that is
#               named 'pre-commit' there.
